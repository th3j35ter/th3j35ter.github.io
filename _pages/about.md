Hello! My name is **Logan Williams**, and Iâ€™m a third-year Computer Science student at **Southern Illinois University Edwardsville**, with a minor in Criminal Justice. I expect to graduate in **December 2026**.

My career goal is to work as a **Cybersecurity Specialist** for an organization or agency committed to making the world a safer, more equitable place through technology. Long term, I plan to pursue **public service**, including a potential run for Congress, with a focus on modernizing flawed government systems and bringing forward-thinking, tech-driven reform to the federal level.
