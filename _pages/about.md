Hello, I am the owner of this page and my name is Logan Williams. I am a 3rd year Computer Science Student at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. My goals for the future once I graduate in December 2026 is to find work as a CyberSecurity specialist for a company or agency that I believe is making the world a better place. Eventually, I will pursue change in the systems that exist as they do today in a flawed state. I plan on running for Congress in some capacity to bring the representation that people desperately need and apply a forward way of thinking to modernize the Federal Government.
